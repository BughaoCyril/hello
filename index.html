    <p> Weapons play a very important role in crossfire. The type of gun you choose will strongly affect your style of playing, whether it is aggressive lightning-fast attacks or firing from protected positions.</p>
    <p> In addition, the weapon you like can be upgraded. All guns have four modifications, from the weakest to the strongest (from M0 to M3). Accordingly, the price of the junior modification isn't high. You can already try the most popular tactics at junior ranks without having to spend a large amount of crystals. But it's impossible to get everything you want at once. Particular guns and modifications can be purchased only with a certain rank.</p>
    <p> It’s important to know that some guns in the game have a maximum range. On distances greater than this range, these guns may do no damage at all. If the distance is greater than the max damage range, the maximum and minimum damage statistics congruently decrease until the minimum damage range is reached, at which damage values become identical to the weak damage. For example, If it says that “up to 50m – 100%, after 100m – 20%”, then the gun’s damage stats will decrease from 100% to 20% between 50 to 100 meters. </p>

	  <h3>  REC7 </h3>

      <p>  The REC7 is Barrett’s second AR-pattern rifle chambered for the 6.8mm Remington SPC cartridge, the first being the Barrett M468 rifle. The 6.8 SPC-chambered M468 rifle employed the same direct gas-impingement system as the M4. The result was a system that jetted hot gases directly into the rifle’s receiver, leading to potential stoppages if regular maintenance and cleaning protocols were overlooked. To enhance potential mechanical reliability, Barrett incorporated a short-stroke, piston-driven system that offers the potential for cleaner and cooler operation than one with direct gas-impingement. Barrett is still selling its limited stock of the M468 but only as an upper receiver kit and not as a complete rifle. </p>

      <p>  The Army is issuing Soldiers a new small arms 5.56 ammunition magazine designed expressly for the M4/M4A1 carbine and M16 family of weapons.

The 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA, was the first unit to receive the new "Enhanced Performance Magazine (EPM), as free issue In July," said Anthony Cautero, Assistant Product Manager for the M4/M4A1 Carbine.

      <p>Almost from the moment of its official adoption by the Soviet military in 1949, the AK-47 was recognized as being simple to operate, rugged, reliable under trying conditions, and amenable to mass production. Built around a 7.62-mm round with a muzzle velocity of some 700 metres per second, it had a cyclic firing rate of 600 rounds per minute and was capable of both semiautomatic and automatic fire. A long curved box magazine held 30 rounds, and a separate gas-return tube above the barrel held a piston that was forced back upon firing to activate the mechanisms that ejected the spent cartridge and cocked the hammer for the next round. The AK-47 was manufactured in two basic designs, one with a wooden stock and the other, designated the AKS, with a folding metal stock. Beginning in 1959, the AK-47 was replaced in first-line Soviet service by the AKM, a modernized version fitted with longer-range sights and cheaper mass-produced parts, including a stamped sheet-metal receiver and a plywood buttstock and forward grip. </p>
